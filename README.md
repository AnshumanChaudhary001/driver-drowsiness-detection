## 🧩 Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend (Web)** | Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS |
| **Mobile App** | Android (Kotlin / Java) |
| **Backend** | Next.js (API Routes / Server-side Logic) |
| **Database** | Firebase |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Camera Feed:** Captures live video of the driver.  
2. **Face & Eye Detection:** track eye blinks and facial states.  
3. **Drowsiness Detection:** Classifies driver state (Alert / Drowsy).  
4. **Alert Mechanism:** Sends real-time audio alerts and updates dashboard and app.
